**WHO AM I?**

![aboutme](/images/aboutme.png)

My name is Harshini and I have just finished my first year studying Philosophy, Politics & Economics at the King's College London. 

During my personal Year 13 application to King's College London, I amassed a large amount of resources and knowledge regarding the UK university application process. From spreadsheets with comparitive information on the top UK universities, to folders containg 40+ successful personal statements of students that I personally know; I am well equipped when it comes to the world of university applications. 

Beyond this, I taught at Harrow International School Hong Kong during my gap year and gained an even greater insight into the multifaceted world of applications. In aiding the UK university application process for students in Hong Kong, I understood further the extracurricular roles and leadership positions desired by specific universities, and the ways in which to tailor these experiences within a personal statement.

All in all, I believe that I have a sound understanding of what makes for a good UK university application, and would love to share this expertise for those encountering this journey for the first time.
