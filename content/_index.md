University is a place which provides numerous benefits. It allows you to dive further into subjects that interest you with likeminded students and high calibre tuturs and mentors. Beyond this, it gives you the opportunity to grow as an individual. Independence, adaptability and tolerance are few of the many charecteristics one may learn in university. The experience as a whole shapes you in a unique way and is worth exploring as a future avenue.
